Project Title
Hospital Trusts Medication Analysis

Problem Statement
Hospital trusts need to monitor and optimize medication costs, utilization, and efficiency. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into prescribing patterns, cost trends, and overall efficiency, ensuring resources are used effectively.

Goal and Objectives
Goal:
To analyze hospital trusts' medication data to improve cost efficiency and enhance prescribing practices.

Objectives:

Identify trends in medication costs and quantity dispensed.
Highlight the relationship between costs and quantities across hospital trusts.
Determine the top-performing trusts based on medication utilization and efficiency.
Data
The project uses anonymized NHS prescribing data for the period of April to June 2024. Key variables include:

Total Quantity Dispensed
Actual Cost and Net Ingredient Cost (NIC)
Trust Names and Medication Details
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Monthly Trends:
Analyzed trends in medication costs and quantities dispensed.
Identified a cost efficiency ratio of 0.96, indicating close alignment between actual costs and NIC.
Scatter Plot Insights:
Relationship analysis between actual cost and quantity dispensed revealed that higher quantities generally resulted in lower unit costs.
Top Trusts by Dispensed Medication:
East Kent Hospitals led with 12.4K prescriptions, followed by Bedfordshire Hospitals (10.9K prescriptions).
Tools Used
Microsoft Power BI: For creating dashboards and visualizing data insights.
Python/Pandas: (If applicable, let me know if you used Python for preprocessing.)
Microsoft Excel: For data cleaning and initial exploration.
Deliverables
Interactive KPI Dashboard: Comprehensive visuals analyzing medication costs, utilization, and efficiency for different trusts.
Actionable Insights: Recommendations for improving prescribing practices and reducing costs.
